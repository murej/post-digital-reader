[to] increase rather than obstruct the agency of the interactor”</i>, essentially appealing to create transparent technology, which efficiently solves problems. While this is clearly an advancement in making technology humane, it should also strive to make technology colourful. <i>“User-friendliness helps naturalize electronic objects and the values they embody. (...) their use is constrained by the simple generalized model of a user these objects are designed around (...) objects, it seems, must be understood, rather than interpreted.”</i> In order to encourage curiosity, we need to enable users to interpret and perceive it in new and meaningful ways.</p>

Bitcaves collective’s project The Netbook and Its Library questions this ecosystem of books in the digital age, by hacking Amazon’s selling system in order to gain access to that knowledge. By default Amazon offers customers random clippings of content as a “sneak preview”. If persistent enough, you can collect and free the whole book from the ecosystem, which, with the help of digital technology, is exactly what they were able to pull off.</p>

Kaplanian Buller considers it from an emotional standpoint and divides reading into cold and warm activities, stating that <i>“cold reading is for gathering information involving head-thinking and fast eye movement,” whereas “warm reading happens when we open our hearts.”</i> She further implies that in an increasingly higher-paced world, <i>“a clearer division between warm and cold reading will emerge. (...) The authenticity of being able to run your hand over the page touched by the author or previous owner is a warm experience which we will increasingly crave as we are engulfed with cold texts.”</i></p>
